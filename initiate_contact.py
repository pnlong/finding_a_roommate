# DM ACCOUNTS
message = "Hi fellow Muiron! Congratulations on your acceptance! I created this account to deal with the backlog on @ucsandiego.2027; at the same time, a lot of the people posted to the account were irrelevant to me, since they were not in Muir and I cannot room with them. Would you like to be posted to this account? If yes, please respond by sending 3-5 pictures of yourself + a bio, in that order (personally, I would reuse what I sent / plan to send to @ucsandiego.2027). If no, just don't respond. Though this account is supervised by a real person, many of its functions are automated, so if you could abide by the aforementioned rules, it would make the posting process a lot smoother. Thanks for your time, and again, congrats!"
